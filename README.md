### Hi! ðŸ‘‹

I specialize in developing data-driven medical/scientific content and insights for Pharma and consumer health.
I have collaborated with top Pharma companies to deliver content that ranges from publications to educational material for HCPs and consumers. 
My expertise also include consultation on scientific and medical marketing strategies.

Also, I am passionate about developing techniques to automate data extraction from congresses and databases, and creating workflows to streamline data visualization.
Outside of Pharma, I find inspiration as a guitarist, and I have been fortunate to play with well-established artists in Singapore and to tour internationally.

Drop a message if you are keen to collaborate or to just have a chat about Pharma or music!
